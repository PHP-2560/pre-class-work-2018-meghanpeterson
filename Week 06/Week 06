1. Read the source code for each of the following three functions, puzzle out what they do, and then brainstorm better names.

```
f1 <- function(string, prefix) {
#arguments for this function are string and prfix
  substr(string, 1, nchar(prefix)) == prefix
#this function extracts substrings in a string. It starts to replace at 1 and stops when the count of the number of characters equals the number in the prefix.
#I would replace f1 with "match_prefix"

```{r}
?substr
```
  
}
f2 <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) <= 1) return(NULL)
#For this function, it removes the last value of x.
  x[-length(x)]
#I would rename this function remove_last
}
f3 <- function(x, y) {
  rep(y, length.out = length(x))
#This function takes arguments x and y. It replicates y the same number of times as the length of x. 
#I would rename this function replicatey_xtimes

```
{r}
?rep
```
}
```

2. Compare and contrast rnorm() and MASS::mvrnorm(). How could you make them more consistent?

<b> mvrnorm is from the package MASS. It produces >= 1 samples from the specified multivariate normal distribution. rnorm is used to generate n normal random numbers with arguments mean and sd. You could make them more consistent by renaming them. 
</b>




3. Use `lapply()` and an anonymous function to find the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by the mean) for all columns in the mtcars dataset. 

```{r}

?lapply

coefficientofvariation <- function(x) {
  coeffofvar <- sd(x) / mean(x)
  return(coeffofvar)
}
 
lapply(mtcars, coefficientofvariation)
 ```
 
 


4. Use vapply() to:
    a. Compute the standard deviation of every column in a numeric data frame.
    b. Compute the standard deviation of every numeric column in a mixed data frame. (Hint: you’ll need to use vapply() twice.)
